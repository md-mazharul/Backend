 In this project, I am creating a student database where you can see the student's id, full name, GPA, current year, major, number of classes the student has taken, username, and password. You can add, delete and update this student information. Additionally, you can get the student's information by using their id, GPA, current year, major, or number of classes the student has taken. 

In this project, I am using java as a language. I am using the spring boot database framework. I am using the CRUD database. So, you can use Postman to see the data.
